# Great Leaders Know How To Whiteboard
TODO is this title good?

    There isn't one startup I walk into today that doesn't have at least 3 whiteboards in their office. Whiteboarded communication was a medium established over a decade ago to replace chalkboards and the long-handed approach of compiling Word docs and sending emails. What makes an effective whiteboarder? Why are some individuals straying away from the medium? It's such a great medium to rapidly communicate and brainstorm ideas with a team and should be the first form of communication when being purely verbal fails.

    When have you ever had a meeting where deep into discussion you feel the "thought-track" is being lost? The real hero of that meeting will run up to a whiteboard and start jotting notes with loose form. The cadence of the meeting quickens and you feel comfortable - you have a scribe, visions are emerging from words in front of you. Flows, UMLs, software and hardware-level architecture diagrams start spewing on the whiteboard.

    In our heads we have that vision of a stock photo of an individual standing in the front of the room whiteboarding and the rest of the group pondering and contributing to the brainstorm. How far from reality that can be at times. Whiteboarding is so incredibly important to any startup company and here's what makes an effective, efficient whiteboarder:

1. **You sympathize with how others can learn from your drawings.**
    Your diagrams make sense, your rhetoric is logical, and you can flow from every piece of the whiteboard to another. If not, you can distringuish one distinct idea from another.
2. **You are open to rapid iteration and development of a thought.**
    As your audience is contributing to you you scribe what they are saying, are flexible flowing from one idea to another, even if it involves throwing away an idea and replacing it for a better one. It's whiteboarding - anything goes and there is no bad idea. The only failure.
3. **You have good handwriting.**
    Seriously! How painful is it when someone has bad handwriting and you have no idea what they are writing? Your handwriting needs to be a work of art on a whiteboard so when the meeting ends it's easy to take a picture and upload it to the cloud.
4. **This isn't your pedestal to orate, this is your opportunity to lead a brainstorm.**
    If you aren't writing down one word for every sentence coming out of your mouth you're doing it wrong.

End by saying go draw something on a whiteboard right now but remember, the pen is mightier only if the ink makes sense.
