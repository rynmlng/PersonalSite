#Running From Nothing

Interest in running in high school because my brothers did it.

Coach had no experience with training associated with being a harrier.

Picked up a book, Jack Daniels’ Running Formula.

First thing I did wasn’t apply anything in the book, I instead learned that it’s important to listen to the athletes.

I started applying base-training, phased I-IV championship training, and optimizing wokouts based upon the topography of the courses we would race in.

Listening to the athletes was the most important, because running is an all-body sport. Every joint, muscle, and tendon must work at 100% to give 100%.

What happened? Our names littered newspapers, we gained attention at the micro level in the highest-famed running state in the country at the time as underdogs, and scared the living hell out of teams with legacy.
