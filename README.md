# PersonalSite
This repository is a collection of all the code and environment setup required to run a personal site catered to a specific individual.


## Coding Style
To encourage unified coding style and system file structure here are some guidelines to follow for contribution:

* Indentation
  * No tabs
  * All front-end code: 2 spaces
  * All back-end code: 4 spaces

* Casing
  * JavaScript is camel-cased
  * All other languages are lowercase, hyphens for word separation
  * Files are all lowercase, underscores for word separation

* Commenting
  * All functions should have their signatures commented because names alone cannot explain what something does.
  * Comments elsewhere should be lightweight enough that they need not be highly maintained.


## Future Ideas
* Add flip effect to the main web page
* Device-related fingerprint authentication
* Cross-platform music-sharing section
