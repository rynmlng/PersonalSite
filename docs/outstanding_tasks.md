# Outstanding Tasks

Here is a list of outstanding tasks that need to be completed for this project...

## Features
* [x] Download all external assets
  * [x] Lato font and include via css link tags
  * [x] imgur image and implement local

* [ ] Mobile-friendly
  * [ ] Hamburger button for nav
  * [ ] Single image clicked goes to full-screen (what about small preview?)
  * [ ] Font-sizes (move to em?)

* [x] Identity gallery
	* [ ] Should be images uploaded manually, weekly
  * [x] Compress images, thumbnails?
  * [ ] Scotch tape effect on image corners

* [ ] Top-down CSS review & cleanup, nix anything commented

* [ ] Mobile, narrow-browser CSS

* [x] Navigation
  * [x] Waypoint to hide/show nav
  * [x] Bookmark nav movement
  * [x] Go to Top link (kind of lame, maybe just make the first section identity?
  * [x] Clicking on Identity goes to top of page, b/c Identity section is at the top

* [x] Section UIs
  * [x] Identity
  * [x] Nav (all that's left is to make a position fixed
  * [x] Quote
  * [x] Social
  * [ ] Blog (collection of thoughts, full breakdowns too)

* [ ] Copyright blog material

## Bugs
* [x] First and second banner don't align on their left side. Taking off `justify-content: center` fixes it,
        but breaks everything else.
* [x] Gallery preview should disappear when nav is engaged mid-preview. A mouse-out event may help.
* [x] Laggy when scrolling due to making all images opaque.
